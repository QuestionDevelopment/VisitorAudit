Visitor Audit
==================

Visitor Audit is a small/lightweight plugin designed to give you insight into your current visitor's behaviour.  It will provide you with a simple view of what computers are currently connected to your wordpress instance and what their recent page views are. Geolocation, browser and OS information is provided to make traffic analysis easier. Page load benchmarks let you easily determine your visitor's experience. An automated slow page report can be configured to email you anytime the visitor experience degrades.  Visitor statistics are instantly compiled to help you determine if a visitor is human/machine and useful/malicious.  With a simple click you can temporarily or permanently ban any IP address. Automated banning functionality is present but is extremely simple and is not recommended.
